# Latex Illustrator Script

This script allows for LaTex text and equations to be inserted in Adobe Illustrator.

This script is a fork of [mkuznets version](https://github.com/mkuznets/latex-illustrator). 

This updated script contains the following improvements:
- MacOS version;
- Easy editing of the LaTex text;

## Installation
### Windows
The script `LaTex Win.js` should be copied to `C:\\Program Files\Adobe Illustrator CC 2018\Presets\en_US\Scripts` (or something similar dependening on your install location and version of Adobe Illustrator).

Furthermore, you should install the fonts corresponding to the fonts used by LaTex. These fonts can be in found in the installation folder of your Tex distribution. E.g. for MikTex, the fonts can be found in `C:\Programs\MiKTeX 2.8\fonts\type1\public\amsfonts\cm` (the files for other math fonts can be found in other folders inside the `amsfonts` folder). THe Windows compatible fonts have the extension `*.pfm`. To install the fonts either dubble-click on the font in Windows Explorer to install them or copy them to the `C:\\Windows\Fonts` folder . Note that Illustrator needs to be closed when installing these fonts, otherwise Illustrator cannot see/load them.

### MacOS
The script `LaTex Mac.js` should be copied to `/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2018/Presets/en_US/Scripts` (or something similar dependening on your  version of Adobe Illustrator).

## Usage
